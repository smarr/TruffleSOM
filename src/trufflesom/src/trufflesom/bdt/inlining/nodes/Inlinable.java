/**
 * <code>Inlinable</code> nodes can be replaced, inlined with arbitrary other nodes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note, {@link Inlinable} is different from {@link Inline}. Nodes marked
 * with @{@link Inline} are replacing more general nodes, which typically have
 * <code>Inlinable</code> nodes as their children.
 *
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the replacement nodes for an <code>Inlinable</code> node will be at least
 * logically sub-nodes of the inlinable node.
 *
 * <p>
 * An example for an <code>Inlinable</code> node is a lambda (closure, block) that
 * represents for instance the body of a for-each operation. The for-each operation can be
 * annotated with @{@link Inline}, so that it's children, which include the node representing
 * the lambda are then inlined. Concretely, the node to replace the <code>Inlinable</code> node
 * would likely be the {@link RootNode} of the lambda.
 *
 * @param <SB> the concrete type of the used {@link ScopeBuilder}
