 * A {@link Variable} represents a variable most often in the user code, or sometimes internal

 * <p>
 * Generally, we expect variables to be read or written, but do not require an
 * implementation the writing operation, since variables might be immutable and initialized
 * otherwise.
 *
 * <p>
 * Some special variables, such as <code>this</code> can require extra handling and can thus
 * require the use of special nodes. We provide here factory methods for <code>this</code>-like
 * variables as well as <code>super</code>-like reads.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that variable access are typically associated with a <code>contextLevel</code>. The
 * precise semantics is specific to your language's use of {@link Scope}s. But generally, we
 * assume that scopes are defined lexically, and a context level of 0 means the local scope,
 * and every increment represents one step outwards in a scope chain.
