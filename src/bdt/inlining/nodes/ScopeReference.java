 * A reference to the scope is typically an access to some type of variable, which might be
 * realized as an access to a {@link Frame} with a FrameSlot. More generally, it is any
 * reference that might need to be adjusted after scopes have been changed. Scope changes can
 * be cause by inlining, which usually means that some scopes get merged, or because of
 * splitting, which separates scopes. In either case, nodes with scope references need to be
 * adapted, which is done with {@link #replaceAfterScopeChange(ScopeAdaptationVisitor)}.
